This page won't be indexed in the website, it is just an easier way for me to keep and share the different photo shoots!

I have been taking pictures of different improv events recently, and I will include here a link to the Google Photo albums .B e aware that Google greatly trims the quality of the pictures and videos, so if you need the original files you will have to ask for them!

**Disclaimer**: I always ask the organisers and as many performers as I can before taking pictures, but if at any moment you want me to take down any of the pictures, just tell me! Conact me at me@ginogalotti.com or by any other mean you know to find me, and I will remove it. 

Also, none of the pictures can be use for commercial use without the approval of the phographer (me) and the people involved in the shot.
