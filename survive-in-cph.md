**Thanks for coming to visit us**! We are looking forward to have you around! I am aware how expensive and unique CPH is so, in case you may want it, we have compiled a short list of our personal favourites around the city. 

We will also include a external list of the _must see in CPH_, but this are just the personal recommendations that we usually give on demand (but on an easy-to-share form). If you feel outraged that because something is missing, feel free to tell me on me@ginogalotti.com; and I will include it!

+ [The super touristy stuff (from Visitcopenhagen.com)](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/top-30-attractions).  
  I know, your instagram feed will suffer if you don't take some pics there!

# Our List

+ [The basic neccesities on a short walk from the ICC](/survive-in-cph/nexttoicc).   
  Here we will share the basic food, cafe, stores and drink venues very close to the ICC!

+ [Do you fancy a bite?](/survive-in-cph/toeat).  
  If you want to explore a little bit further, here is a _absolutely-non-biased_ curated list of places we like.

+ [Something to do on a spare afternoon?](/survive-in-cph/spareafternoon).  
  Some things to do when you have some spare hours and you like a little taste of the city.

+ [Staying longer, and want inspiration to do on a day?](/survive-in-cph/spareday).
  Here we will share some 1-day plans to get inspired if you staylonger.

+ [You just want to have fun and get wasted?](/survive-in-cph/toparty).  
  YOLO!
