**Thanks for coming to visit us**! We are looking forward to have you around! I am aware how expensive and unique CPH is so, in case you may want it, we have compiled a short list of our personal favourites around the city. 

We will also include a external list of the _must see in CPH_, but this are just the personal recommendations that we usually give on demand (but on an easy-to-share form). If you feel outraged that because something is missing, feel free to tell me on me@ginogalotti.com; and I will include it!

+ [The super touristy stuff (from Visitcopenhagen.com)](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/top-30-attractions).  
  I know, your instagram feed will suffer if you don't trake some pics there!

# Important info about Copenhagen

* Drinking is legal on the street, so be prepared for it. I have never had any issue nor drama, as it is a fairly safe place; but keep it in mind! Most of the people I know walk home at night with no fear.

* Don't crush the cans/bottles after you're done with them! Many people recollect those to get some extra cash (when you bring them back to the store). Just leave them, without crushing, next to a trash can!

* I am planning on doing a 1 hourish tour around the theatre some of the afternoons. Places like the townhall, Tivoli, Nyhavn, some of the parks, etc. If that's something up your alley, just poke me [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gino.guay) or send me an email!
