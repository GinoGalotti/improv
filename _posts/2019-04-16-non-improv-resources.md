I am not an actor, so most of the characters I create come from me, and I love that! It makes it pretty easy to know how to create better and more rounded characters: I just need to learn more about everything!

Some days ago someone asked for non-Improv resources that will improve your Improv game; and I got SO inspired that I decided to compile some of them and add my personal ones! 

So here I leave you 5 resources that some improvisers find helpful!

# [36 Questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html)

I have done this exercise with friends and partners, and it is such a simple way to kick-start a connection. Going through the questions, it is clear that they create a spark between two characters fast.

This tip will be against the “avoid questions” motto many teachers repeat, but you are bringing a clear brick by asking any of the questions: you really care about your scene partner and you will create or foster their connection.

And that will always make the scene better!

# [Books about life](https://amzn.to/2USPJKE), [and the universe](https://amzn.to/2UhlU1Q), [and human history](https://amzn.to/2G8pKp2)

I can’t bring accents nor pop culture references to my theatre (as I am an expat and I barely speak English); but I can bring plenty of trivia and real-world references.

When I was a teenager, I used to spend my afternoons clicking _random page_ in Wikipedia to discover new interesting topics I might want to learn. It helped me to feel comfortable talking about a big range of topics, which turns to be very helpful in Improv.

Being specific and being able to list details and nuances from a topic will enhance your shows dramatically. Even if a very small portion of the audience is able to fully enjoy the reference, you can count that they will have a blast. 

Some of my best memories involve making jokes that only a handful of people could understand, but they felt SO included because of it!

# [Funny/ironic news](https://www.drudgereport.com/?fbclid=IwAR0RajT8vrzL5Yo_B2wdplp7Sc32kkPEcuDqoQnYxMeN6HstI49gANoAWQc)

There are many sites like that (The Onion is probably the biggest one), and all of them can serve as a hilarious starting point for a scene or a set. 

I love using Improv as a world-building tool for all those _what if_ questions. _What if Improv was forced as a grade 5 subject_, _what if humans learnt how to fly_, _what if UK left EU_… see? They all are hilarious premises!

You can even use a similar tool to ask for suggestions that will inspire your show: _"What is an Ironic news header that you wouldn’t be surprised to see on an actual newspaper?"_. There is so much to explore with just that! Extra points if you don’t even mention the actual news, just how it might affect our world.

# [Board games]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-11-board-game-lessons %})

I love board games, and I have already talked in length about them; one can’t help himself!

Many board games are amazing to build and create silly situations, and I find it SO inspiring! I can’t help but think of playing _lines from a pocket_ with Cards Against Humanity cards!

Spending time with your assembly will always improve your game on stage. And games are such a fun way to discover more facets of them!

# [Ted Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks)

Ok, I have to admit that I am obsessed with Ted Talks. For a long period, I used to watch two a day during my lunch break, and I can’t get enough. 

I don’t know if it is the appeal of being biteable sizes of science, how emotional they are or the format; but I have learnt SO MUCH from them! Many times it is just a sneak peek that will make me curious and want to dig deeper on the matter, but Ted talk is how I found [Esther Perel](https://www.ted.com/talks/esther_perel_the_secret_to_desire_in_a_long_term_relationship) and [Alain de Botton](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success), for instance!

It serves a similar purpose than reading about life, the universe and everything else; it leaves you with some bits of knowledge and hopefully the spark of inspiration that will make you explore a new subject on stage!

Many times our character should be an expert on a subject and, even if we are not expected to actually know everything about it when I can relate it to a Ted talk that piqued interest on me… it will hopefully spark interest in the audience and my scene partners as well!!

# What about you?

But tell me, which are the resources that inspired you? Have you had any revelation moment reading an article or watching something on youtube? Please, share! I would love to hear about it!
