Improvisation is expanding every year. Last time I checked, only 13% of people mentioning "improvisation" on Facebook (using Facebook audiences) came from the USA. Next on the list, there was Mexico with 10%, Brazil with 10% and 5% from Italy. It is amazing seeing how improvisation spreads! 

I made the decision to learn and perform improv in English, like many others. But there is a subject that has always interested me: How is that affecting my performances? 

I am not talking about the obvious, like feeling less comfortable with accents or not sharing the same cultural references. I mean how does it affect our way of playing. Are there any formats which are harder because of it? Or easier games? Can we adapt our classes to an international crowd? I have been asking this questions around my theatre and decided to share it with you guys.

As a very short background (you can read [the long version here](https://ginogalotti.github.io/improv/theatrebackground/)): I'm Gino, a Spaniard who started improvising in Denmark. On my first class, there were 3 Danes, 2 native English-speakers and 10 from everywhere else. When I graduated, a third were Danes and a third were native speakers. Can we avoid such a big drop out? Can we support them so we have a more diverse cast?

# How is this affecting us?

This is what I ask myself all the time.

I sometimes need an extra second on fast-paced games. For example, short-form games which require quick answers or openings like Scene Painting. On the later, the game really shines when the tempo increases until people are almost talking over each other. And I didn't want to admit that it was an issue, but I can tell it is a challenge for me.

I didn't realise I struggled with this till I went to London, joined a workshop (where I was the only non-native speaker), and played exercises that focused on getting into the "intuition" headspace. [Alan Marriott](https://www.londonimprovtheatre.com/workshops-alan-marriott) explained to us the three ways of reactions. Reacting emotionally, following our guts, most of the times just being sounds and grunts. Intellectually, when we process and find the correct answer. And intuitively, that feeling of being on autopilot, when you are not aware of the answer till after you say it. 

He explained how powerful is to improvise on in that state and propose some exercises. In one of those, we had to pull objects from an imaginary box at such a fast pace that you couldn't prepare what came next. Most people needed 40-60 things within a couple of minutes to get there, but I found it impossible to achieve in English. Those 5 milliseconds, which I wasn't aware of, that I needed to come with the word was wrecking the exercise for me. When I switched to Spanish.. it felt so easy!

And I am not even concerned about how I know English is limiting my improv... But all the other things which are being affected without me being aware!!

# What to keep in mind while playing with us

What shall we keep in mind if we are playing with (or teaching) a non-anglophone team? One of the questions I have been asking around. I don't have an extensive list yet, but I hope to keep adding notes new experiences like yours.

The more physical, the more inclusive it is. I might be biased by having a Commedia dell'arte partner, but most people agreed that physicality is fair ground. Training scenes with limited speaking or focusing on our movements will empower performers regardless of their English expertise.

Be mindful with techniques such a tag runs or some fast openings. I love fast-paced games. But, I have to admit, I enjoy them more with a supportive cast who understand that speed won't be my forte. I will, of course, chip in; but I get anxious when feeling that I have to carry them.

# Which strengths we bring to the table

I deeply believe there are many advantages of having a more diverse (in any possible way) cast. 

The most obvious one? It brings new voices, new points of view. There is a new world of possibilities that I bring to the table. We will have different cultural references, with all the nuances that bring. And I am not only referring to your TV references (luckily, we can't use any in our theatre with such a diverse audience!). 

Bringing communism to this scene? It will be enhanced by having our Romanian partner, whose family was really affected by those years. Playing that Italian waiter? You will play it to the top of your intelligence with your Milanese friend on the side.

Having command over several languages is a very powerful perk, especially when your theatre is next to a hostel. I have seen roaring when failing to deliver a common phrase in Danish. Or using your mother tongue to enhance a scene, giving that extra golden nugget to some lucky audience members. And the countless short-form games where we can use this. I have a lovely memory of a Romanian friend performing a scene in Spanish only with the telenovela lines she learnt from TV!

And I can't even count all the different uses of English we make just by being polyglots. I really recommend [this amazing TED talk explaining how languages shape your way of thinking](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think?utm_source=whatsapp&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tedspread).

# Amazing people working on this

I haven't heard of many people studying or working on this (so I decided to start the conversation within my community!). But there are many workshops related to some of these struggles. I am planning to contact some of the teachers to hear about their experiences so we can share the lessons learnt!

On Lyon festival, you can find several related workshops. [Joe Bill is teaching "Playing with the Languages of Improv"](http://www.festival-improvidence.com/speaker/joe-bill/), exploring the different ways to communicate in a scene, some using your mother tongue. [Tim Orr is leading a "Silent Scene" workshop](http://www.festival-improvidence.com/speaker/tim-orr/) as well. 

Giving the unique situation we have at our theatre, I am looking forward to doing more research! Let's make improvisation even more inclusive!

# Your turn to help

There are no ads on this blog. I am not selling workshops. You can't even come to see my shows. If I am taking the time to write this it is because I believe we can grow together. And, for that, I really need your help. 

What are your experiences with this? Is English your mother tongue? Which exercises are you finding particularly hard? Do you teach? 

Feel free to engage in the comments below. If you want to dive deep on this subject, or you want to share something, my email is more than open: gino.galotti@gmail.com. I am planning to keep asking around and learning about the topic so this won't be my last post about improvising as a non-native English speaker!
