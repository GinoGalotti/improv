Improvisation is expanding every year. Last time I checked, only 13% of people mentioning "improvisation" on Facebook (using Facebook audiences) came from the USA. Following, on the list, there were 10% coming from Mexico, 10% from Brazil and 5% from Italy. I love seeing this art form is spreading everywhere! 

Personally, like many others, I made the decision to learn and perform improv in English. But there is a subject that has always interested me: how is practising it in English affecting our performances? 

I am not talking about the obvious, like feeling less comfortable playing with accents or not sharing cultural references. I mean how does it affect our way of playing. Are there any formats which are intrinsically harder? Or games that are easier? Is there any way we can adapt our classes to an international crowd? These are the kind of questions I have been asking around my theatre, and here are some of the ideas we talked about.

As a very short background: I'm Gino, a Spaniard who started improvising in Denmark. On my first class, there were 3 Danes, 2 native English-speakers and 10 from anywhere else. On my team when I graduated, a third were Danes and a third were native speakers. Was there any preventable reason to avoid such a big drop out? Is there any way to support them so we have a more diverse cast? You can read a little bit more about [my background here](https://ginogalotti.github.io/improv/theatrebackground/), so we can keep the conversation focused!

# How is this affecting us?

This is the big question I ask myself all the time. Besides the obvious points already stated, like cultural references or trying to rhyme, how is the situation affecting us?

I sometimes need an extra second on fast-paced games. I am talking about many short for games where you need to listen and answer fast or openings like Scene Painting. On the later, the game really benefits from increasing the tempo until people are almost talking over each other adding new elements. I didn't realise it was an issue, but I can tell it is quite a challenge for me.

I didn't realise I struggled till I went to London, joined a workshop (where I was the only non-native speaker), and we played exercises that focused on getting into the "intuition" headspace. [Alan Marriott](https://www.londonimprovtheatre.com/workshops-alan-marriott) explained to us the three ways of reactions. Reacting emotionally, just following our guts, most of the times we just make sounds and grunts. Intellectually, when we process and find the correct answer. And intuitively, that feeling of being on autopilot, you are not aware of the answer till after you say it. 

We stated how important was to improvise on an intuitive state and practice with many exercises. In one of those, we had to pull objects from an imaginary box at such a fast pace that you couldn't prepare what came near. It took most people 40-60 things within a couple of minutes to get there, but I found it was impossible to achieve that in English for me. Those 5 milliseconds, which I'm not aware of, that I need to come with the English word was wrecking the exercise for me. When I switched to Spanish.. it felt so easy!

So I'm not concerned about what I know I'm limited by improvising in English... But all the other things that are being affected without me realising it!!

# What to keep in mind while playing with us

What shall we keep in mind if we are playing in a non-anglophone team, or teaching a non-Native crowd? This is one of the questions I have been asking around. I don't have an extensive list yet, but I hope to keep adding notes from your experiences.

The more physical it is, the more inclusive. I might be biased by having a Commedia dell'arte partner, but most people agreed that physicality is fair ground. Training scenes with limited speaking or focusing on the body will empower performers regardless of their English expertise.

Be mindful with techniques such a tag runs or some fast openings. I love playing those games. But I have to admit, I enjoy it more when I have a supportive cast who understand that speed won't be my forte. I will, of course, chip in; but I get anxious when feeling that I have to carry the game.

# Which strengths we bring to the table

I deeply believe there are many advantages of having a more diverse cast, in any possible way. 

The most obvious one? Bringing a new voice, a new point of view. There is a world of possibilities that I bring to the table. We will have completely different cultural references, with all the nuances that bring. And I am not only referring to your TV references (luckily, we can't use any in our theatre with such a diverse audience!). 

Are you bringing communism references to the scene? I am sure they will be enhanced by our Romanian cast member whose family was really affected by those years. Are you playing that Italian waiter? I am sure you will play it to the top of your intelligence with your team member from Milan.

I also feel having command over several languages is a very powerful perk, especially if your theatre is next to a hostel. I have seen audiences bursting into laughter when trying to deliver a common line in Danish. Or enhancing the scene by yelling in your mother tongue, giving that extra golden nugget to some lucky audience members. And the countless short-form games that can use this! I have a lovely memory of a Romanian friend performing a scene in Spanish only with the telenovela lines she learnt from TV...

And I can't even count all the different ways to use English we have just by being polyglots. If you haven't seen it, I really recommend you [this amazing TED talk explaining how languages shape your way of thinking](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think?utm_source=whatsapp&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tedspread).

# Amazing people working on this

I haven't heard of many people studying or working on this (this is why I decided to start the conversation on my community!). But there are many workshops that are related to some of these struggles. I am planning to contact some of these teachers to hear about their experiences, so we can make our teaching more inclusive!

On Lyon festival, you can find several workshops. [Joe Bill is teaching "Playing with the Languages of Improv"](http://www.festival-improvidence.com/speaker/joe-bill/), exploring the different ways to communicate in a scene, and playing with scenes on your mother tongue. [Tim Orr is leading a "Silent Scene" workshop](http://www.festival-improvidence.com/speaker/tim-orr/) as well. 

Giving the unique situation we have at our theatre, I am looking forward to doing more research so we can really explore it.

# Your turn to help

There are no ads on this blog. I am not selling workshops. You can't even come to see my shows. If I am taking the time to write this is because I really believe we can grow together, and for that, I really need your help. 

What are your experiences with this? Is English your mother tongue? Which exercises are you finding particularly hard? Do you teach? 

Feel free to engage in the comments below. If you want to further study this subject, or you want to share something, my email is more than open: gino.galotti@gmail.com. I am planning to keep asking around and learning about this, so this won't be my last post about improvising as a non-native English speaker.
