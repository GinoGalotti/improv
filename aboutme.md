This page is a very much Work in Progress. If you are interested on a place where I regularly share things and you can find me, feel free to check [this blog's facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/improveinimprov/).

My name is Gino Galotti. I am a Spaniard guy living in Copenhagen that has been performing improv since 2017. These are the reasons why I think I am cool:

- I am an engineer, so I overanalyse every hobby.
- I'm doing improv in Copenhagen (Denmark).
- I read way too much. You can check my [my reading lists on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42769624-gino-galotti).
- My mum says I am cool.

What else do you need?

### Improv experience

[I wrote](/theatrebackground) a little bit of my improv theatres and my experiences on the classes.

Besides the shows that are part of our theatre, I started performing with a close friend on a set called Two Manly Men. You can see [one of our shows](https://youtu.be/m8lprpjlJqY).

I also have started to help with the promotion material of the shows, taking [pictures](/show-pics) with [my new baby](https://amzn.to/2UckBVQ); as well as creating some short videos.

### My life

I was born in Tenerife, although no one knows why I ended up in one of the coldest places on Earth. I still keep my funny accent. If you want to know more, just ask.

I also [write](https://callmegino.wordpress.com/) about other non-improv things.
