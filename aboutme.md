My name is Gino Galotti. You killed my father. These are the reasons why I think I am cool:

- I am an engineer, so I overthink any hobby I join
- I'm doing improv in Copenhagen (Denmark)
- I read way too much
- My mum says I am cool.

What else do you need?

### My history

I was born in Tenerife, although no one knows why I ended up in one of the coldest places on Earth. I still keep my funny accent. If you want to know more, just ask.

I also write [here](https://callmegino.wordpress.com/) about other non-improv things.
