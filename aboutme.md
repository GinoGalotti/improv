This page is a very much Work in Progress. If you are interested on a place where I regularly share things and you can find me, feel free to check [this blog's facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/improveinimprov/).

My name is Gino Galotti. You killed my father. These are the reasons why I think I am cool:

- I am an engineer, so I overanalyse every hobby.
- I'm doing improv in Copenhagen (Denmark).
- I read way too much. You can check my [my reading lists on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42769624-gino-galotti).
- My mum says I am cool.

What else do you need?

### My history

I was born in Tenerife, although no one knows why I ended up in one of the coldest places on Earth. I still keep my funny accent. If you want to know more, just ask.

I also write [here](https://callmegino.wordpress.com/) about other non-improv things.
