The break is super short and you need something on 10min walk from [our beloved ICC](https://goo.gl/maps/YPLkpnTMpt12)? Hope that this help!

# Coffee? WHO SAID COFFEE?

There is nothing more Danish than overpaying for hygge in a cup. There are plenty of design and stylish cafes around, but we are here to give some options really close to the ICC.

+ **Emmerys.** [Link to Map](https://goo.gl/maps/Ek3AUf1zziF2). It is _literally_ in front of the ICC, did you really need one?
  This organic bakery chain offer ok coffee for around 50kr (6.7€). It closes at 6pm, and you can grab a bunch of lefover bread using the [TooGoodToGo](https://toogoodtogo.com/en) phone app for 30kr (3.5€) if you go right before they close.
