You are here already. You are a person with a mission, but you are in Copenhagen anyway, so why don't get a little taste of the city? Let's get some snaps so your Instagram feed believes you came to Denmark!

**TIP**: If you're planning to visit Tivoli, feel free to ask around because some of us have Year Tivoli cards. Even if they are personal, there are ways to use lend them. Feel free to [poke me on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gino.guay).

This is not an extensive list by any means. If you want to check the must sees, please consult any official guide like [VisitCopenhagen](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/see-do) or [LonelyPlanet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/denmark/copenhagen). If you are up for an adventure, you can even use [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/copenhagen-denmark).

Here I am going to share the things I recommend my guests outside of the main areas, in case you want to feel inspired!

# So you want green

+ **Frederiksberg have** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/) Closest metro Frederiksberg - Free  
  Frederiksberg is a small city inside the city. I like to think of it as the Royal Neighbourhood, as everything look and sound so posh. I really like this park to just stroll around, have a peak on the elephants (it is next to the zoo) or just have a picnic on the nice slope. 

+ **Cemetery** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/7NL26iQ9xTR2) Closest metro Nørreport - Free  
  My guests usually like the idea of seeing a city embracing its cemeteries. It feels like a park (first time I was there, I saw a cheerleadering team practising; and it's pretty common seeing plenty of cuddling and not-so-PG-13 snuggling on summer there).

+ **Deer forest and Bakken** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/TkeVXmGiA7p) 30 min train ride - Free  
  The theme park (Bakken) might be close (depending on the season). If it's sunny and not too cold, it's a pretty cool walk on the nature, and I have found very approcheable deers many times! Better than most of my Tinder dates.
  
# So you want water

You came to a city with a beach... why don't take advantage of that? I know, it is probably freezing, but when has that stopped you from having fun? 

I would encourage you to try some of the Spa experiences but I don't have any particular recommendations on that regard!

+ **Amager Strand** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/TkeVXmGiA7p) Closest metro Amager Strand - Free  
  If you're brave enough, I love freaking my friends out with Sauna or Winter bathing on the beach. It iscold as hell, but it is more common that what you think. And most people are shocked by how natural and different feels the Danish relationship with nature and nudity. This is the beach I usually go for having some walks and maybe dipping my head.

+ **The Harbour** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/2CmH6co4La32) - Free  
  During the (week of) Summer, I love coming to this structure and jumping head first to the water. It is perfectly safe and quite magical being in a city where I can just do that. The city spent a lot of money and time cleaning the waters of the harbour so people could enjoy them at any point.

# So you want a museum
You have the regulars: [National Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/nvNmVG9Cfbz) with story and culture, [Glyptotek](https://goo.gl/maps/khJidffJwvR2) as Carlsberg's private art collection, [SMK](https://goo.gl/maps/8pD7XcXuBY12) as an art gallery and the [Danish Design Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/NFSiXHLuCFU2) if you want a dip on Denmark's biggest export (besides beer). If your jam is modern art, you can take a 40 minutes train to [Louisiana](https://goo.gl/maps/dJM4X2z1x3P2).

But here are some of the ones I love that are slightly less mainstream.

+ **Medicine Museum** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/gothtMf6PzE2) - Can't remember the price  
  Very small collection of utensils and techniques that have been hisorically used for medical purposes. As a son of a Doctor, I dig this stuff

# So you want a pretty view

But we came here for the pretty pictures... didn't we?

+ **Parlament Tower** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/EdmS8hZXxBp) - Free  
  Depending on the time, you might have to queue, but it is the second tallest view of the (flat) city, and the only one which is actually free (and easy to climb).

+ **Kastellet** - [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/vBzg4jnHDvy) - Free  
  This funny-shaped park (next to the Little Mermaid) was my place to disconnect and ponder about the day after work. It has a pretty view of the sea, it is green enough and you can find silly things to take pictures with. What else do you need?

# None of these is what you were looking for? 

Don't be afraid! Ask around! We are more than welcomed to help you on anything, and it can be an amazing way to break the ice. If you think that I am missing a MUST HAVE on the list, feel free to drop me an email me@ginogalotti.com

Also, poke me [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gino.guay) if you need a quick answer (or a pointer to a better person to ask).
