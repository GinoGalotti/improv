Privacy Policy
====================

# How we process your data
This website is powered by Jekyll, with a domain from Namecheap, comments powered by Facebook and is hosted on GitHub. Github (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

## Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses, use SSL at all time and we have agreed a Data Processing Amendment with Google. These measures were taken from a derective of the CBP (Dutch Institute for Privacy Protection) from March 2013 on how to legally use Google Analytics while not showing a cookie warning.

## Facebook Comments

You can read more about it on [their website](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). We use Facebook as our provider for comments on the site. You can always block the facebook cookie using many plugins or just simply [following this guide](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-to-disable-facebook-cookies).

In line with GDPR, you can request to be deleted from the mailing list at any point through MailChimp ubsubscribe option (on every email) or by sending an email to me@ginogalotti.com.
